</header>

 <p>Hi, thank you for visiting my site, I am delighted to have you here. If we have not had the pleasure of yet meeting in person please allow me to tell you a little about myself, I am a Miami native, lived in Muncie Indiana for 11 years where I Studied Accounting, Information Systems and Graphic Arts at Ball State University, Muncie Indiana. Chirp Chirp!. Inversed myself into the world of print and found my passion, continued my education at FIU and currently studying Graphic and Web Design at Miami Int. University of Art & Design located in Downtown Miami. 
<p>Became a Deltasig during my Sophomore year.
  <br>However, as an artist total complete satisfaction comes from seeing my work in the physical realm, my passion is in print.
