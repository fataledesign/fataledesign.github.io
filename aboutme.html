  <h1>About Al</h1>
</header>
  
<p>Studied Accounting, Information Systems and Graphic Arts at Ball State University, Muncie Indiana. Chirp Chirp!
<p>Became a Deltasig during my Sophomore year.
<p>Currently studying Graphic and Web Design at Miami Int. University of Art & Design located in Downtown Miami.
  <br>However, as an artist total complete satisfaction comes from seeing my work in the physical realm, my passion is in print.
